# OpenAI-Assistant-API-Cleanup




This repository contains Python scripts for bulk deletion of OpenAI assistants and files. The scripts fetch a list of all assistants or files, display them, and ask for user confirmation before deletion. If confirmed, the resources are deleted in parallel using multithreading for efficiency. The scripts also provide an option to delete all resources in a loop until there are none left. These scripts are useful for managing and cleaning up resources in an OpenAI environment.
